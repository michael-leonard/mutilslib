== Why can't the compiler find "dfport"?==

If you are linking Fortran to MATLAB to produce .m files, you are required to add the following directory to: 

`Project Properties | Fortran | Additional Include Directories |` _{{{[MATLABInstallDir]}}}_`\extern\lib\win32\microsoft`

In IVF11.0.074 this results in the compiler *not* being able to find the module `dfport` in file `dfport.f90` located in directory:

 _{{{[IFortInstallDir]}}}_`fortran\include`

Removing the directory for MATLAB is a quick-fix to this problem, but does not solve the reason for the conflict. 

It has been noted as an issue for investigation in the future
