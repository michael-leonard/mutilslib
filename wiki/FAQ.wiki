== How can I fix a compiler error "Can't find dfport"?==

If you are linking Fortran to MATLAB to produce .m files, you are required to add the following directory to: 

`Project Properties | Fortran | Additional Include Directories |` _{{{[MATLABInstallDir]}}}_`\extern\lib\win32\microsoft`

In IVF11.0.074 this causes the compiler to *not* be able to find the module dfport in file dfport.f90 located in the directory:

 _{{{[IFortInstallDir]}}}_`fortran\include`

Removing the directory for MATLAB resolves this problem
